# Continuous Integration Script
#
# This script contains all the test commands for this app, and should be run on
# your continuous integration server. Developers can then run it locally to see
# if their changes will pass on the CI server, before pushing.
#
# It also allows the build settings to be changed by anyone with write access to
# the project repo, making them easier to manage.
